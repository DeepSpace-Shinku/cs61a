# cs61a

## Introduction
The self-study solution for cs61a course at UC Berkeley. The content of this repository was done during the second half of 2020 and stored locally. And was uploaded to GitHub in 2021 as a backup and a reference for anyone who interested in the course.
This repository contains all the code work of the course, including labs, homework, and projects (discussions and final not included). The materials are divided into two parts. The first part is lab00 - lab07-su and hw01 - hw05-su, which is for the summer 2020 version of the course. And the second part is lab07 - lab12 and hw05-hw09, which is for fall 2020 version of the course. All the code can pass the autograding program used for this course -- ok with full credit, which is provided by the cs61a official website. The following is the detailed information about each part of the repository

## Projects
4 projects that implement the theory of the course

### Hog
Hog is a simulation of a traditional rolling dice game – hog written by Python. Except for the basic rules, some optional rules were also implemented to make the game more interesting. Serval play strategies are also implemented so that you can play against the computer.

### Cats
*Cats* is a Python program that measures typing speed. Additionally, typing autocorrect is also implemented, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. This project is inspired by typeracer.

### Ants
Ant is a tower defense game named *Ants Vs. SomeBees* written by Python just like *Plants vs. Zombies*. Different ants and bees have different abilities. Two types of positions – land and water are also implemented. This project focus on object-oriented programming.

### Scheme
This project is a scheme interpreter written by Python. The interpreter is made for a subset of the Scheme language. This project implements REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). It will remind you to think about many problems arise in the design of a programming language; many quirks of languages are byproducts of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. 

## MT
Midterm for the 2020 summer course with solution.

# cs61a
 The self-study solution for cs61a course at Berkeley. The code was done during the second half of 2020 and stored on local machine. And was uploaded to GitHub in 2021 to be a backup and a reference for anyone who interested in the course. This repository contains all the code work of the course, including labs, homework and projects (discussions and final are excluded). The matrials are divided into two parts. The first part are lab00 - lab07-su and hw01 - hw05-su, which is for the summer 2020 version of the course. And the second part is lab07 - lab12 and hw05-hw09, which is for fall 2020 version of the course. All the code can pass the autograding program  -- ok with full credit, which is provided by the cs61a offical website.
